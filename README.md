PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Garments Worker Productivity Analysis project focuses on analyzing real-world production data from a garment manufacturing industry.
This project aims to identify patterns, trends, and factors that influence worker productivity using data analytics and visualization techniques.
The dataset contains detailed information about:
Target productivity
Actual productivity
Working hours
Incentives
Idle time
Over time
Department and team details
This analysis helps understand operational efficiency and performance gaps in the garment sector.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
The main objectives of this project are:
To analyze worker productivity trends.
To compare target productivity vs actual productivity.
To identify factors affecting productivity.
To detect performance gaps.
To generate meaningful business insights using data visualization.

Seaborn – Statistical visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

🔍 METHODOLOGY
1️⃣ Data Collection:
The dataset contains real garment factory production records.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Data type corrections
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution of productivity
Department-wise performance
Overtime analysis
Incentive impact analysis
4️⃣ Data Visualization:
Graphs and charts were created to:
Compare actual vs target productivity
Identify high and low performing teams
Analyze overtime impact
Observe productivity trends over time

📊 KEY ANALYSIS PERFORMED
✔ Productivity comparison (Target vs Actual)
✔ Department performance evaluation
✔ Correlation between overtime and productivity
✔ Impact of incentives on worker performance
✔ Idle time analysis

📈 RESULTS & FINDINGS
After performing detailed analysis, the following insights were observed:
🔹 In many cases, actual productivity was lower than target productivity.
🔹 Excessive overtime did not always improve productivity.
🔹 Incentives showed positive influence on productivity levels.
🔹 Certain departments performed consistently better than others.
🔹 Idle time significantly reduced performance output.

📌 BUSINESS INSIGHTS
Proper workload planning can improve productivity.
Incentive-based motivation improves worker performance.
Monitoring idle time can increase operational efficiency.
Balanced overtime scheduling is essential for sustainable productivity.

🚀 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Apply Machine Learning models to predict productivity.
Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau.
Deploy as a web application.
Automate productivity reporting system.

💡 CONCLUSION
This project demonstrates how data analytics can help improve industrial productivity.
By analyzing worker performance data, businesses can make informed decisions to increase efficiency, reduce operational loss, and improve employee performance.
